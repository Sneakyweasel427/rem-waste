Redesign of skip hire page 

I freshend the UI with a cleaner, more modern look, removing the redundant images that took bacndwidth to load but provided no actual addition to user feel or experience, as well as freshening the color scheme. 

I used MUI Cards among other MUI components to create standardized look and feel among the elements on the page.

I maintained the animated information at the bottom that appears upon selection and implemented a grid system for the cards that works well across all screen sizes. The styles are designed to be "mobile-first".
